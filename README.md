# Simple webchat

A simple chat app based on websockets

## Running
After cloning run
```
node server.js
```
Then in a separate terminal
```
cp .env.example .env
npm i
npm run dev
```
Note: If needed change the url on .env as pointing to localhost will only work in your machine

## TODO
* Add some validation for websocket state
* Add a user is typing feature
* Add markdown
